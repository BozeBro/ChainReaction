This is the recreation of the Chain Reaction game commonly found in the app store. 
The game is not available on the web so I have decided to create it myself.
The gist of the game is to add a circle onto a square, and when there are more circles than
its neighboring squares, the square will "Explode".
All squares that are hit by the explosion will have their circles converted.
The last player standing wins the game.

Simple Rules:
You cannot physically add circles on other people's squares.
